# HateSpeech_Dataset

Our research was accepted at ICPR 2024, where we showed the effectiveness of Multimodality in detecting hate speech. we have generated both hate and non-hate speech samples by transforming text excerpts from the ToxiGen dataset into audio representations.  1000 random text samples belonging to both hate and non-hate classes are selected to generate the audio samples, comprising 502 non-hate sentences and 498 hate sentences. We utilized the Speech T5 pre-trained model to transform the text into audio, achieving seamless conversion through advanced language processing techniques.  Within the SpeechT5 framework, various speakers are available, including two distinct male voices, BDL and RMS, and two female voices, CLB and KSP, along with a Surprise Me! voice. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we generated the audio dataset using four distinct voices: two male voices (BDL and RMS) and two female voices (CLB and KSP). We utilized both the male voices, BDL and RMS, and generated 1,000 audio samples for each using a specific set of texts. Similarly, employing the same set of 1,000 texts, we generated audio using the CLB and KSP female voices.
